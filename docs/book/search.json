    "text": "Biodiesel\nIn 2023, the production of B100 increased 20.3% when compared to the previous year, reaching 7,527,659 m³.\nThe average percentage of B100 compulsorily added to mineral diesel increased from 10.0% to 11.5% in 2023. The main raw material was the soybean oil (62.2%), followed by other fatty materials (14.7%).\n\n\nSugarcane, Sugar and Ethanol\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply (MAPA), the sugar cane production in the calendar year 2023 was 712.7 million tons. This amount was 19.7% higher than in the previous calendar year, when the milling was 595.3 million tons.\nIn 2023, the national sugar production was 45.8 million tons, 26.1% higher than the previous year, and the production of ethanol increased by 11.3%, yielding the amount of 31.2 million m³.\nAbout 59.8% of this total refers to hydrous ethanol: 18.7 million m³. In comparative terms, the production of this fuel increased 14.4% compared to 2022.\nRegarding the production of anhydrous ethanol, which is blended with gasoline A to form the gasoline C, there was an increase of 7.0%, totaling 12.5 million m³.\n\n\nCorn Ethanol and Other Biomass\nThe production of ethanol from corn and other biomass reached 5.86 million m³ (being 3.53 million m³ of hydrated ethanol and 2.33 million m³ of anhydrous ethanol) in 2023, representing 15.8% of the total produced in Brazil.\n\n\nElectricity\nThe electricity generation in the Brazilian public service and self-producers power plants reached 708.1 TWh in 2023, an amount 4.6% higher than the result for 2022.\nThe public service plants remain as the main contributors, with 79.9% of total generation. Hydropower, the main source, decreased 0.3% compared to the previous year.\nThe autoproducers (APE) generation in 2023 accounted for 20.1% of total production, considering the aggregate of all sources used, reaching 142 TWh. Of this total, 81.1 TWh are produced and consumed in loco i.e. by own generating facility usually named as classic APE. The classic self-production aggregates the many different industrial facilities that produce energy for their own consumption, like Pulp and Paper sector, Steel, Sugar and Alcohol, Chemical, among others, besides the Energy Sector.\nThe electricity generation from non-renewable sources accounted for 11.0% of the national total, compared with 12.3% in 2022.\nNet imports of 15.1 TWh, added to internal generation, allowed a domestic electricity supply of 723.2 TWh, an amount 4.8% higher than 2022. The final consumption was 616.3 TWh, an expansion of 5.2% compared with the previous year.\nFigure 2.1 shows the structure of the domestic supply of electricity in Brazil in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Electricity generation: non-renewable sources. Others: Other Non-Renewable, Other secondaries, Coke Oven Gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Total Electricity Supply by Source. Other Renewable: Includes Firewood, Biodiesel and Other Renewables. Other Non-Renewable: Includes Fuel Oil, Coke Oven Gas, Other Secondaries and Other Non-Renewables.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazil has an electric mix of predominantly renewable origin, with emphasis on the hydroelectric source. Considering that almost all imports come from Itaipu power plant, the hydroelectric source reaches a share of 58.9%. Renewable sources account for 89% of the Brazilian domestic electricity supply. This is the result of the sum of the amounts referring to domestic production plus imports, which are essentially renewable.\nOn the final consumption side, there was an increase of 5.2%, reaching 616.3 TWh in 2023. Industrial and Residential sectors accounted for 36.4% and 27.5% respectively.\nFigure 2.3 and Figure 2.4 show the changes in 2023 sectoral electricity consumption compared to the previous year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Percentual change of electricity consumption per sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Growth of electricity consumption in the industrial sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe industrial, residential and commercial sectors accounted for 80.8% of the consumed electricity in the country in 2023.\nIn 2023, Brazil’s total installed capacity for electricity generation (public service and self-service power plants) reached 199,325 MW, an increase of 10,198 MW, not including mini and micro distributed generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Electricity consumption share by sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the expansion of installed capacity, wind power plants contributed with 4,920 MW, about 48% of the total added.\nThis edition of BEN publishes technical note for estimating thermal solar Annex VI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Participation of energy sources in the installed capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWind Energy\nThe production of electricity from wind power reached 95.8 TWh in 2023. This represents a 17.4% increase over the previous year, when it reached 81.6 TWh.\nIn 2023, the installed capacity for wind power generation in the country increased by 20,7%. According to the Power Generation Database (SIGA), from National Agency of Electric Energy (ANEEL), the national wind farm reached 28,664 MW by the end of 2023.\n\n\nMicro and mini energy generation\nThe micro and mini distributed generation of electricity was stimulated by regulatory actions, such as the one that establishes the possibility of compensation of surplus energy produced by smaller systems (Net Metering). In 2023, the micro and distributed minigeneration reached 30,950 GWh with an installed capacity of 26,627 MW, specially the solar photovoltaic power plant, with 29,813 GWh and 26,366 MW of generation and installed power capacity respectively. Details of the generation and installed capacity of micro and distributed minigeneration are presented in tables 5.5.b and 8.4.b, respectively.\n\n\nPetroleum and Oil Products\nThe domestic production of oil increased by 12.6 % in 2023 reaching an average of 3.4 million barrels per day, of which 98 % are offshore. The State of Rio de Janeiro was responsible for the largest share: 85.6% of the annual amount. On the other hand, onshore production continues to be led by the State of Rio Grande do Norte, with 41.0% of the total onshore.\nOn the consumption side, increases of 1.8% for fossil diesel oil and 6.9% for automotive gasoline were recorded. The transport sector accounted for 71% of the total energy consumption of fossil diesel oil.\n\n\nNatural Gas\nThe average daily production for the year was 149.8 million m³/day, and the volume of imported natural gas was an average of 17.7 million m³/day. Thus, the natural gas share in the national energy matrix reached the level of 9.6%.\nNatural gas demand decreased by 6.1% over the previous year, mainly due to the reduction of natural gas electricity generation, which decreased by 11.4% compared to the previous year.\nFigure 2.7 shows the destination of natural gas for the years 2022 and 2023. In 2023, 28.6% of the gas consumed in the country was used to generate electricity. In 2022, this percentage was 30.3%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Natural gas consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteam Coal and Metallurgical Coal\nIn electricity generation, the coal used is steam coal, predominantly of national origin, whose producing states are Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. Steam coal demand for this end-use increased by 14.7% over the previous year.\nMetallurgical coal destined for the production of coke, following the movement of the steel industry, decreased 4.9%.",

    "text": "Oil and Natural Gas\nEstimates of the volume of oil and/or gas are measured under the basic atmospheric conditions, multiplying the recovery factors (checked by engineering studies of reservoirs) by the proven volume of oil or gas discounting the volume produced up to the reference date.\n\nRecovery Factor: it is the index that measures the efficiency of the techniques used for extracting the natural energy contained in the reservoir, as well as the additional external energy introduced into the reservoir, in order to produce a certain amount of oil and/or gas of the originally proved volume.\noriginal volume of oil and/or gas: it is the volume of oil or gas checked in basic conditions, originally existing in the reservoir.\ncumulative production of oil and/or gas: it is the volume of oil and/or gas measured under basic condition, extracted from the reservoir up to the time of evaluation.\npressure and temperature basic conditions:\n\nAbsolute pressure: 1 atm. = 1.0332 kg/cm² (14.7 psi)\nTemperature: 20º C\n\n\n\n\nShale Oil\nConcepts of resources and reserves for shale oil are those adopted by the Brazilian Mining Code:\n\nResources: concentration of solid, liquid or gaseous materials occurring naturally inside or on the surface of Earth’s crust so that economic extraction is usually or potentially feasible.\nIdentified Resources: specific deposits or bodies of solid, liquid or gaseous materials, whose location, quality and quantity are known through geological evidences or prospection in a greater or lesser degree of detail.\nReserve: portion of an identified resource from which an useful mineral or energy can be economically and legally extracted, at the time of its identification.\n\nThe definition of the terms “measured”, “indicated”, and “inferred” are applicable to both reserves and identified resources, depending on the degree of details of the research work performed:\n\nMeasured: refers to materials for which the estimates of quantity and quality have been computed with a margin of error of less than 20%, with detailed geological research and with systematic and representative sampling analysis.\nIndicated: materials for which quality and quantity estimates have been computed both by detailed geological research and representative sampling, and by reasonable geological projections (extrapolation).\nInferred: materials for which quality and quantity estimates are based only on certain geological evidences and projections.\n\n\n\nCarvão Mineral\nCoal reserves have been determined as follows:\n\nMinimum thickness: 0.5 to 1.0 m of coal in layer.\nMeasured reserve: reserve within a radius of 400 meters and an area of 0.5 km² , around the bore hole.\nIndicated reserve: reserve external to the measured reserve within a radius of 1,200 meters from the holes, covering an area of 4.02 km².\nInferred reserve: reserve situated beyond the indicated reserve, up to a maximum distance of 4.8 km from the bore holes. The reserves shown in the balance sheet are geological “in situ”. For determination of recoverable reserves should be taken into account the losses in mining and benefaction, as well as problems due to faulting and diabasio intrusions.\n\n\n\nHydraulic Potential\nHydraulic potential is the potential which can be technically and economically exploited under existing technological conditions.\nHydro-electric potential is measured in terms of firm energy, meaning the largest power that can be generated during the worst hydrological period.\nInventoried hydro-electric potential includes operating and in construction power plants and those for which a basic and feasibility study has been prepared.\nConsidering the inventory as the base in which the potential is measured with high precision, it is possible to evaluate the precision of the values obtained for the estimated potential.\nAccording with evaluation studies, that have already been proceeded, the estimated values stay up to 35% under the final inventoried value, thus it can be concluded that the estimated potential is very conservative.\n\n\nUranium\nIn Brazil, uranium reserves follow the conventional geological classification based on the criteria classification of the Brazilian Mining Code – measured, indicated and inferred.\nThe table information shows the geological reserves, because of the calculation of oil equivalence is based on the assumption that there are up to 30% losses in mining and benefaction.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency – IAEA – has its own classification, which includes the criterion of cut-off for the cost of extraction and benefaction of the uranium.\nCorrespondence between the classifications: \n\n\nBiomass\nBiomass, intended for energetic use, is a primary, non-fossil, energy source consisting of organic matter of animal or vegetable origin. Biomass contains stored energy in form of chemical energy. Regarding its origin, biomass for energy purposes can be classified in the categories of forest biomass, its products and by-products or waste; agricultural biomass, agro-energy crops, wastes and by-products of agricultural, agroindustrial and animal production activities; and urban waste.",

    "title": "Annex IV: Useful Energy Balance",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Useful Energy Balance - BEU (as in Portuguese “Balanco de Energia Util”) is a study that allows sectorial information on energy consumption from the National Energy Balance to be processed to obtain final energy estimates. These estimates are destined to the Final Uses Matrix, Process Heat, Direct Heating, Refrigeration, Illumination, Electrochemical and Other Uses and based on the yields of the first transformation process, will estimate useful energy.\nUseful Energy is calculated using Final Uses, the forms of Final Energy and the activity sectors contemplated in the National Energy Balance. Figure 1 summarizes the results of the BEU for the years 1984, 1994 and 2004.\nFinal energy is composed of the sum of two parcels: useful energy and lost energy. This in turn is composed of the sum of the Economic Energy Potential (EEP) and Non-Recoverable energy (NRE). Useful energy is calculated base on efficiency averages of the installations of each activity sector, in the year under study. The EEP is estimated using the efficiency of the most modern installations for each activity sector, in the year under study. The NRE is calculated by the difference.\nThe figure shows that Final Energy and Useful Energy have increased during these two decades. On the other hand, the EEP has reduced as processes’ yields have come close to their paradigms.\nThe Final Energy Ratio/ Useful Energy ratio has the dimension of energy yield. The BEU allows an evaluation of the global energy yield of Brazilian society and the specific yields by activity sector of the different forms of energy and the Final Uses. Table 1 shows the evolution of global energy yields for the main activity sectors by activity sector of the different forms of energy and the final uses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Variation of the final energy, useful and Economic Energy Potential evolution 1984 – 2004\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following table shows that the energy yields have increased over these decades. This increase is due partly to the technical evolution of equipment and partly to changes in the country’s energy matrix which has migrated towards the use of more efficient energy sources.\nThe BEU allows a separate evaluation of the effects of the evolutions of technology and society on national energy consumption. To evaluate just the effects of the societal change the entry data were considered (Final Energy data – characterizing the social context) for the years of 1984, 1994 and 2004, however with the yields (that characterize technology) for the year 2004. To evaluate only the effects of technology the data for 2004 was used, with the yields for 1984, 1994 and 2004. The results obtained for average yields are shown in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Evolution of the Energy Efficiency, Sectors and Final Use Brazil. Unit: %.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2 allows a simple inspection to show that the effects of technology are on the whole greater than the effects of society. To quantitatively check the participation of these effects on the variation of the yield it is necessary to process these figures. This process is explained below using the example of the variation of global yield between 1994 and 2004:\n\nTotal Yield Variation = 57.5 (Tab IV.2) – 53.9 (Tab IV.1) = 3.6\nVariation due to Technological Effects = 57.5 (Tab IV.2) – 54.3 (Tab IV.2) = 3.2\nVariation due to Societal Effects = 57.5 (Tab IV.2) – 56.9 (Tab IV.2) = 0.6\nVerification: 3.2 + 0.6 = 3.8 ~ Total Yield Variation\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Evolution of the Energy Efficiency, Sectors and Final Use Brazil. Unit: %.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3 shows the variations related to all the sectors in this study.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Evolution of Energy Efficiency: Participation of Technology and Society Effects - Brazil. Unit: %.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be verified that there are some, usually small, variations between the values of the Total Variation column and the Verification Column. These variations reflect small errors due to inconsistencies between the entry data and the technical coefficients in the model that appear in this simulation.\nIt is interesting to observe that, in the Residential and Direct Heating sector, between 1984 and 2004, society’s effect is significantly greater than in other periods. This variation is due to the substitution of firewood stoves in the residential sector in the decade of 1984 to 1994.\nThe effect of technology is particularly significant in the case of segments such as the Industrial Sector in which competitiveness propels the increase in energy efficiency or energy inputs used in this area.",

Informations referring to sales made directly by the refineries are furnished from Petrobras. The information referring to sales made by the distributors to consumers is furnished by ANP, which is regulated by Decree CNP-DIPLAN n.° 221, dated June 25, 1981 and is broken down according to Federal Revenue Bureau criteria.

In the balance calculations fossil coal after benefaction, in the forms of steam and metallurgical coal is considered primary energy.\n\n\nNuclear Energy\nIn the Brazilian Energy Balance, the accounting of nuclear energy is according to the following flow: the natural uranium in the form of U3O8 (primary energy) enters in the nuclear fuel cycle (transformation center) and is transformed into uranium in UO2 fuel elements (secondary energy), with the losses due to the manufacturing process.\nDue to the large number of activities involved in the processing of natural uranium in the form of U3O8 into enriched uranium contained in UO2 pellets, components of the fuel elements, the average processing time is 21 months (without taking into account the recycling time of uranium and plutonium from the fuel already irradiated).\nBecause of this, all the uranium that is in being processed in the nuclear fuel cycle is considered as inventory of U3O8. Every year an account is made for the amount of uranium (content of the UO2) put out of the inventory. Losses of 1.5% due to the transformation are considered in the account.\n\n\nHydraulic Energy and Electricity\nIn this case hydraulic generation is the gross electricity production as measured at the hydraulic plants. The portion corresponding to leaked energy is not considered.\n\n\nFirewood and Charcoal\nProduction of firewood and charcoal is determined based on consumption data, not taking into account any inventory variation. Firewood sector consumption data, except those from Pulp and Paper and Non-ferrous Industries, from which real consumption data are furnished, are obtained through extrapolation of the data from the Energy Matrix Project, 1970, from IBGE survey and by means of correlation with the sector consumption of the energy products, such as LPG in the residential sector.\nCharcoal: the industrial sector consumption is directly obtained from the consumers. The consumption data of the other sectors is obtained in the same manner as for firewood. Charcoal production is calculated taking in account percentage losses in distribution and storage.\n\n\nSugar Cane Products\nThey are obtained from squeezed Sugar-cane to produce sugar and alcohol. It is considered as primary products the cane juice, molasses, bagasse, leaves and points, and as secondary products the anhydrous and hydrated alcohol. Each ton of squeezed Sugar-cane produces around 730 kg of Sugar-cane juice (it is not considered the water used in the Sugar-cane wash). Concerning the bagasse, it is considered only the energetic use. The technical note COBEN 03/88, mentioned in the item 5, provides more information about this subject.\n\n\nCoke\nProduction and consumption data are directly obtained from industries (CSN, COSIPA, USIMINAS, AÇOMINAS, and others). Energy import and export data are provided by the Federal Revenue Bureau.",

    "text": "Electricity in the Brazilian Energy Balance – BEB\nThe previous editions of the Brazilian Energy Balance 2002 adopted criteria to evaluation of the electricity and hydroelectricity generation segments considered the thermic base parameters, that means 1kWh = 3132 kcal, which corresponds to the fuel oil burned in a thermoelectric plant with an yield of 27.5%. This resulted in a conversion index of 0.29 toe/MWh (3132/10800kcal/kg), which increase the hydraulic energy values in order to compare with the other countries eminently with thermic generation.\nThe Brazilian Energy Balance 2002 adopted, for hydraulic and electricity supply and consumption, the conversion factor 0.08 toe/MWh (1 kWh = 860 kcal). However, it maintained the petroleum reference of 10,800 kcal/kg and the use of superior calorific powers to the energy sources.\nIn this edition, and in the last one these conversion criteria for electricity and hydraulic generation kept in the theoretical base (1 kWh = 860 kcal), but it were adopted the petroleum reference of 10000 kcal/kg and inferior calorific powers for the other energy sources. These new criteria are in agreement with the international criteria, specially the ones of International Energy Agency, World Energy Consul, Latin-American Energy Organization and, United State energy Department.\n\nMETHODOLOGICAL NOTE – MICRO AND MINI DISTRIBUTED GENERATION ESTIMATION\nThis Note records the methodology used to estimate the total electricity production coming from micro and mini electricity power plants, until the base year of 2020.\nThe estimate is made by quantifying the energy contribution of each existing generation system present in ANEEL’s database. The following equation is used in the estimation\n\\[ E_{f,m,s} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_{i,f,m,s} \\times{FC_{f,m,s}} \\times{Z_{b}} \\times{24} \\times{(1-k)^{Z_{T}}} \\]\nWhere:\n\nEf,m,s is the electricity generated in the reference year, with the source f, municipality m and sector s.\ni is the index for each generation system in operation in the base year, being incremented from the first to the total n;\nPi,f,m,s is the installed capacity of system i, from source f, in the municipality m, in sector s;\nFCf,m,s is the capacity factor for source f, in county m and sector s;\nZb is the number of days of operation of the Pi power in the base year;\nk is the daily degradation factor of the technology. For the photovoltaic source, it was calculated as (1+0,005)(1/365) -1. For the other sources, k is equal to zero;\nZt is the total number of days in operation for Pi from its installation until the end of the base year.\n\nIt should be noticed that for the new plants that start operation during the reference year of the Brazilian Energy Balance, the generation estimation considers the proportional operation to the number of days that the unit was connected during the base year. For the plants registered in previous years the operation during the entire year is considered.\nTo estimate the capacity factor of photovoltaic systems, the following formula is used (adapted from Zilles, 2012):\n\\[ FC_{m,s} = \\frac{PR_{s} \\times{GTI_{m}}}{24 \\times{I_{STC}}} \\]\nOnde:\n\nPR is the Performance Ratio. It is a factor that incorporates losses due to temperature, dirt, DC/AC conversion, inverter efficiency, etc. It is assumed a value equal to 0.80 for remote systems installed at high voltage and 0.75 for other systems (based on Pinho and Galdino, 2014). This is justified by the fact that ground systems have better orientation of the modules and more frequent cleaning, which ensures lower production losses.\n\\(GTI_m\\) is the daily average global global irradiation on the inclined surface for the municipality m. Obtained from the Brazilian Atlas of Solar Energy - 2nd Edition (Pereira et al., 2017).\n\\(I_{STC}\\) is the irradiance at standard test conditions = 1 \\([kW/m^2]\\).\n\nThe daily degradation factor for PV technology is based on annual degradation equal to 0.5% per year. This annual value is the median of the studies reviewed by Jordan and Kurtz (2012).\nThe capacity factors used for the other sources are presented below. The values were obtained from the generation verified in larger plants, whose generation is measured by the CCEE.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Capacity Factors for different sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Capacity Factors for hydro source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that the municipal data are aggregated according to BEB’s needs.\nReferences\n\nJORDAN, D.

Thus, the specific mass and the inferior heating values, observed in each year, are showed in the balance.\n\n\nSteam Coal\nThe brazilian steam coal is produced in several ways concerning its physical and chemical characteristics, presenting ash contents from 20% to 54% and several variations of sulphur, volatiles, fixed carbon and other contents. The coal analysis is done by some processing plants, with their own laboratories, in Science and Technology Foundation - CIENTEC and in the Mineral Technology Center - CETEM.\nIts equivalence to toe is determined from the average calorific powers of the several types of processed coal.\n\n\nMetallurgical Coal\n\nImported: it was adopted the calorific power provided by the National Metallurgical Company – CSN, which stays in the zone of theseveral imported metallurgical coals.\nBrazilian: it was adopted the calorific power provided by CSN.\n\n\n\nUranium – U308\nIt was adopted the coefficient of equivalence provided by Brazilian Nuclear Industry.\n\n\nHydroelectricity and Electricity\nThe equivalence coefficient used was 0.086 tep/MWh, resulting from a caloric equivalence of 860 kcal/kWh. This coefficient was determined by the equivalence of the potential energy of water (mechanical energy) into heat.\n\n\nFirewood\nThe primary unit of firewood is the stere cubic meter (m³ st). It was adopted a density of 300 kg/m³ st for firewood of residential use (colloquially identified as “picking firewood”), average value identified in research made by the Foundation Technologic Center of Minas Gerais - CETEC in cities from Minas Gerais State.\nIt was adopted a density of 390 kg/m³ st for commercial firewood, considering the data provided by BRACELPA. The Technical Note COBEN 04/88, mentioned in Appendix D – item 5, contains greater details about this subject.\n\n\nSugar Cane Products\nThe calorific containts of Sugar-cane, considering its components (“sacarose”, fibers, water and others),is of, approximately, 1060 kcal/kg. Discounting from this quantity the energy existing in the fibers (bagasse), the calorific power for the Sugar-cane juice gets 620 kcal/kg. It was used the value of 1930 kcal/kg for the molasse with 55% of sugar weight reductors and capable of producing 350 liters of alcohol/t. For the bagasse it was used the calorific power experimentally calculated by the former Sugar and Alcohol Institute -IAA.\n\n\nOther Primary Sources\nThis item contains vegetal and industrial residues use by heat and vapor generation. The equivalence to toe was established from the estimated average calorific power. For the Black Liquor, it was used the calorific power adopted by BRACELPA.\n\n\nGasworks Gas and Coke Gas\nThe calorific powers adopted by the Gas Company of Rio de Janeiro State - CEG and Gas Company of São Paulo State - COMGAS.\n\n\nCoal Coke\nIt was used the calorific power theoretically obtained with the use of the Dulong’s Equation, from the chemical analysis of an average coke sampling.\n\n\nUranium Contained in UO₂\nIt was used the equivalence coefficient adopted by the Brazilian Nuclear Industries.\n\n\nCarvão Vegetal\nThe caloric power used was in function of researches done by Belgo-Mineira and Acesita Metallurgical Companies.",
